# OpenTimeLapseSortC

OpenTimelapseSort is a sorting software for professional timelapse photographers, saving them hours of manually sorting sequences and backing up. With OTS you will have the advantage of simply pressing a button while the algorithms sort and import for you. OpenTimelapseSort also keeps a backlog of all imports and offers reimporting and basic import management for all your imports.
